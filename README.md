# A dataset for in-situ contexts where users perceive distractions

We collected in-situ user context and the corresponding smartphone distraction experiences. For this, we implemented an mobile esm app that asks users to report their current contexts (i.e., their locations and activities) and to what extent they smartphone distraction. We performed field data collection with 34 participants for three weeks using the app.

## Detecting moments for response sampling

Requesting responses from users at inappropriate times can cause inconvenience for users, as it may interfere with their ongoing activities. Therefore, finding the right
opportunity for sampling experience is essential [1].
